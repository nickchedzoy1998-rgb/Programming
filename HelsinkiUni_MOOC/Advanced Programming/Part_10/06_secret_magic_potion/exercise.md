# Secret magic potion

The exercise template contains the class definition for a `MagicPotion` which allows you to save a recipe for a magic potion. The class definition contains a constructor along with the methods:

- `add_ingredient(ingredient: str, amount: float)`
- `print_recipe()`

Please define a class named `SecretMagicPotion` which inherits the `MagicPotion` class and allows you to also protect the recipe with a password.

The new class should have a constructor which also takes the password string as an argument.

The class should also contain the following methods:

- `add_ingredient(ingredient: str, amount: float, password: str)`
- `print_recipe(password: str)`

If the password argument given to either of these methods is wrong, the methods should raise a `ValueError` exception.

If the password is correct, each method should call the relevant method in the parent class. Do not copy and paste anything from the `MagicPotion` class.

An example of how this would work:

```python
diminuendo = SecretMagicPotion("Diminuendo maximus", "hocuspocus")
diminuendo.add_ingredient("Toadstool", 1.5, "hocuspocus")
diminuendo.add_ingredient("Magic sand", 3.0, "hocuspocus")
diminuendo.add_ingredient("Frogspawn", 4.0, "hocuspocus")
diminuendo.print_recipe("hocuspocus")

diminuendo.print_recipe("pocushocus")  # WRONG password!
```

Sample output:

```text
Diminuendo maximus:
Toadstool 1.5 grams
Magic sand 3.0 grams
Frogspawn 4.0 grams
Traceback (most recent call last):
File "secret_magic_potion.py", line 98, in <module>
raise ValueError("Wrong password!")
ValueError: Wrong password!
```
