# Game Museum

The exercise template contains class definitions for a `ComputerGame` and a
`GameWarehouse`. A `GameWarehouse` object is used to store `ComputerGame`
objects.

Familiarize yourself with these classes. Then define a new class named
`GameMuseum` which inherits from the `GameWarehouse` class.

The `GameMuseum` class should override the `list_games()` method so that it
returns a list of only those games which were made before the year 1990.

The new class should also have a constructor which calls the constructor from
the parent class `GameWarehouse`. The constructor takes no arguments.

## Example

```python
museum = GameMuseum()
museum.add_game(ComputerGame("Pacman", "Namco", 1980))
museum.add_game(ComputerGame("GTA 2", "Rockstar", 1999))
museum.add_game(ComputerGame("Bubble Bobble", "Taito", 1986))
for game in museum.list_games():
    print(game.name)
```

## Sample output

```text
Pacman
Bubble Bobble
```
