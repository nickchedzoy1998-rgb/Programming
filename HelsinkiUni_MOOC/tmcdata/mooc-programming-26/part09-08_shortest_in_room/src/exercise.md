# The Shortest Person in the Room

The exercise template contains the class `Person`. A person has a name and a height. In this exercise you will implement the class `Room`. You may add any number of persons to a room, and you may also search for and remove the shortest person in the room.

## Task 1: Room Class

Please define the class `Room`. It should have a list of persons as an attribute, and also contain the following methods:

- `add(person: Person)` - adds the person given as an argument to the room.
- `is_empty()` - returns `True` or `False` depending on whether the room is empty.
- `print_contents()` - prints out the contents of the list of persons in the room.

### Usage Example

room = Room()
print("Is the room empty?", room.is_empty())
room.add(Person("Lea", 183))
room.add(Person("Kenya", 172))
room.add(Person("Ally", 166))
room.add(Person("Nina", 162))
room.add(Person("Dorothy", 155))
print("Is the room empty?", room.is_empty())
room.print_contents()
Sample output
Is the room empty? True
Is the room empty? False
There are 5 persons in the room, and their combined height is 838 cm
Lea (183 cm)
Kenya (172 cm)
Ally (166 cm)
Nina (162 cm)
Dorothy (155 cm)

The shortest person
Please define the method shortest() within the Room class definition. The method should return the shortest person in the room it is called on. If the room is empty, the method should return None. The method should not remove the person fron the room.

room = Room()

print("Is the room empty?", room.is_empty())
print("Shortest:", room.shortest())

room.add(Person("Lea", 183))
room.add(Person("Kenya", 172))
room.add(Person("Nina", 162))
room.add(Person("Ally", 166))

print()

print("Is the room empty?", room.is_empty())
print("Shortest:", room.shortest())

print()

room.print_contents()
Sample output
Is the room empty? True
Shortest: None

Is the room empty? False
Shortest: Nina

There are 4 persons in the room, and their combined height is 683 cm
Lea (183 cm)
Kenya (172 cm)
Nina (162 cm)
Ally (166 cm)

Removing a person from the room
Please define the method remove_shortest() within the Room class definition. The method should remove the shortest Person object from the room and return the reference to the object. If the room is empty, the method should return None.

room = Room()

room.add(Person("Lea", 183))
room.add(Person("Kenya", 172))
room.add(Person("Nina", 162))
room.add(Person("Ally", 166))
room.print_contents()

print()

removed = room.remove_shortest()
print(f"Removed from room: {removed.name}")

print()

room.print_contents()
Sample output
There are 4 persons in the room, and their combined height is 683 cm
Lea (183 cm)
Kenya (172 cm)
Nina (162 cm)
Ally (166 cm)

Removed from room: Nina
