# Filtering attempts

> **NB:** Some exercises have multiple parts, and you can receive points for the different parts separately. You can submit a partially completed exercise by choosing **Submit Solution** from the menu next to the button for executing tests.

In this exercise we will continue with the `CourseAttempt` class.

## Accepted attempts

Please write a function named `accepted(attempts: list)` which takes a list of `CourseAttempt` objects as its argument. The function should return a new list of `CourseAttempt` objects, including only those items from the original list whose grade is at least 1.

```python
s1 = CourseAttempt("Peter Python", "Introduction to Programming", 3)
s2 = CourseAttempt("Olivia C. Objective", "Introduction to Programming", 5)
s3 = CourseAttempt("Peter Python", "Advanced Course in Programming", 0)

for attempt in accepted([s1, s2, s3]):
    print(attempt)
```

**Sample output**

```text
Peter Python, grade for the course Introduction to Programming 3
Olivia C. Objective grade for the course Introduction to Programming 5
```

Please implement the function using the `filter` function.

## Attempts with grade

Please write a function named `attempts_with_grade(attempts: list, grade: int)` which takes a list of `CourseAttempt` objects and an integer as its arguments. The function should return a new list containing only those `CourseAttempt` objects from the original list whose grade matches the second argument.

```python
s1 = CourseAttempt("Peter Python", "Introduction to Programming", 3)
s2 = CourseAttempt("Olivia C. Objective", "Introduction to Programming", 5)
s3 = CourseAttempt("Peter Python", "Introduction to AI", 3)
s4 = CourseAttempt("Olivia C. Objective", "Data Structures and Algorithms", 3)

for attempt in attempts_with_grade([s1, s2, s3, s4], 3):
    print(attempt)
```

**Sample output**

```text
Peter Python, grade for the course Introduction to Programming 3
Peter Python, grade for the course Introduction to AI 3
Olivia C. Objective, grade for the course Data Structures and Algorithms 3
```

Please implement the function using the `filter` function.

## Students who passed the course

Please write a function named `passed_students(attempts: list, course: str)` which takes a list of `CourseAttempt` objects and a course name as its arguments. The function should return an alphabetically ordered list of names of those students who passed the course, i.e. their grade for the given course was higher than 0.

```python
s1 = CourseAttempt("Peter Python", "Introduction to Programming", 3)
s2 = CourseAttempt("Olivia C. Objective", "Introduction to AI", 5)
s3 = CourseAttempt("Peter Python", "Introduction to AI", 0)
s4 = CourseAttempt("Jack Java", "Introduction to AI", 3)

for attempt in passed_students([s1, s2, s3, s4], "Introduction to AI"):
    print(attempt)
```

**Sample output**

```text
Jack Java
Olivia C. Objective
```

Please implement the function using the `filter` and `map` functions.
