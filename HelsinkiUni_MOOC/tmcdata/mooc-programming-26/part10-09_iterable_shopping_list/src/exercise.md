An iterable shopping list

The exercise template contains the `ShoppingList` class from the exercise in part 8. Please adjust the class so that it is iterable and can thus be used as follows:

```python
shopping_list = ShoppingList()
shopping_list.add("bananas", 10)
shopping_list.add("apples", 5)
shopping_list.add("pineapple", 1)

for product in shopping_list:
    print(f"{product[0]}: {product[1]} units")
```

Sample output:
```
bananas: 10 units
apples: 5 units
pineapple: 1 units
```

The `__next__` method of your iterator should return tuples, where the first item is the name of the product and the second item is the amount.
