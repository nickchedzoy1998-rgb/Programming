# Simple date

Points: 0 / 3

NB: Some exercises have multiple parts, and you can receive points for the different parts separately. You can submit a partially completed exercise by choosing "Submit Solution" from the menu next to the button for executing tests.

In this exercise you are asked to implement the class `SimpleDate` which allows you to handle dates. For simplicity's sake we assume here that each month has 30 days.

Because of this simplification you should not use the `datetime` module from the Python standard library. You will implement similar functionality by yourself instead.

## Comparisons

Please implement the outline of the class, along with methods allowing for comparisons with the operators `<`, `>`, `==` and `!=`. You can use the following code to test your implementation:

```python
d1 = SimpleDate(4, 10, 2020)
d2 = SimpleDate(28, 12, 1985)
d3 = SimpleDate(28, 12, 1985)

print(d1)
print(d2)
print(d1 == d2)
print(d1 != d2)
print(d1 == d3)
print(d1 < d2)
print(d1 > d2)
```

Sample output:

```text
4.10.2020
28.12.1985
False
True
False
False
True
```

## Increment

Please implement the addition operator `+` which allows you to add a given number of days to a `SimpleDate` object. The operator should return a new `SimpleDate` object. The original object should not be changed.

```python
d1 = SimpleDate(4, 10, 2020)
d2 = SimpleDate(28, 12, 1985)

d3 = d1 + 3
d4 = d2 + 400

print(d1)
print(d2)
print(d3)
print(d4)
```

Sample output:

```text
4.10.2020
28.12.1985
7.10.2020
8.2.1987
```

## Difference

Please implement the subtraction operator `-` which allows you to find out the difference in days between two `SimpleDate` objects. As we assumed each month to have 30 days, a year within the confines of this exercise is `12*30 = 360` days long.

You can use the following code to test your program:

```python
d1 = SimpleDate(4, 10, 2020)
d2 = SimpleDate(2, 11, 2020)
d3 = SimpleDate(28, 12, 1985)

print(d2 - d1)
print(d1 - d2)
print(d1 - d3)
```

Sample output:

```text
28
28
12516
```
