# Passing Submissions

## Exercise Brief

The exercise template contains a class named ExamSubmission which, as the name implies, models an examinee's submission in an exam. The class has two attributes defined: examinee (str) and points (int).

Please write a function named passed(submissions: list, lowest_passing: int) which takes a list of exam submissions and an integer number representing the lowest passing grade as its arguments.

The function should create and return a new list, which contains only the passed submissions from the original list. Please do not change the list given as an argument, or make any changes to the ExamSubmission class definition.

You may use the following code to test your function:

if __name__ == "__main__":
    s1 = ExamSubmission("Peter", 12)
    s2 = ExamSubmission("Pippa", 19)
    s3 = ExamSubmission("Paul", 15)
    s4 = ExamSubmission("Phoebe", 9)
    s5 = ExamSubmission("Persephone", 17)

    passes = passed([s1, s2, s3, s4, s5], 15)
    for passing in passes:
        print(passing)

Sample output:

ExamSubmission (examinee: Pippa, points: 19)
ExamSubmission (examinee: Paul, points: 15)
ExamSubmission (examinee: Persephone, points: 17)
