# Baby Centre Exercise

The exercise template contains a class named `Person` and a skeleton implementation for the class `BabyCentre`. A `BabyCentre` object performs various actions on a `Person` object. It may, for example, weigh or feed the person. In this exercise you will implement the rest of the `BabyCentre` class. Please do not change the class definition of `Person` in any way.

## Weighing Persons

The `BabyCentre` class definition contains an outline for the function `weigh`:

```python
class BabyCentre:
    def weigh(self, person: Person):
        # return the weight of the person passed as an argument
        return -1
```

The method takes a `Person` object as its argument. It should return the weight of the person. You can access the weight of a person through the appropriate attribute defined in the `Person` class. Please fill in the rest of the implementation for the method `weigh`.

Below is an example of a main function where a `BabyCentre` weighs two separate `Person` objects:

```python
baby_centre = BabyCentre()

eric = Person("Eric", 1, 110, 7)
peter = Person("Peter", 33, 176, 85)

print(f"{eric.name} weighs {baby_centre.weigh(eric)} kg")
print(f"{peter.name} weighs {baby_centre.weigh(peter)} kg")
```

**Sample output:**
```
Eric weighs 7 kg
Peter weighs 85 kg
```

## Feeding

It is possible to change the state of an object passed as an argument. Please implement the method `feed(person: Person)` which increases by one the weight of the person passed as an argument.

In the following example two persons are weighed, and then one of them is fed three times. Then the persons are weighed again:

```python
baby_centre = BabyCentre()

eric = Person("Eric", 1, 110, 7)
peter = Person("Peter", 33, 176, 85)

print(f"{eric.name} weighs {baby_centre.weigh(eric)} kg")
print(f"{peter.name} weighs {baby_centre.weigh(peter)} kg")
print() 

baby_centre.feed(eric)
baby_centre.feed(eric)
baby_centre.feed(eric)

print(f"{eric.name} weighs {baby_centre.weigh(eric)} kg")
print(f"{peter.name} weighs {baby_centre.weigh(peter)} kg")
```

The printout should reveal that Eric's weight has increased by three:

**Sample output:**
```
Eric weighs 7 kg
Peter weighs 85 kg

Eric weighs 10 kg
Peter weighs 85 kg
```

## Counting Weigh-ins

Please implement the method `weigh_ins()` which returns the total number of weigh-ins a `BabyCentre` object has performed. **NB:** you will need a new attribute for keeping track of the number of weigh-ins. You can use the following code to test your method:

```python
baby_centre = BabyCentre()

eric = Person("Eric", 1, 110, 7)
peter = Person("Peter", 33, 176, 85)

print(f"Total number of weigh-ins is {baby_centre.weigh_ins()}")

baby_centre.weigh(eric)
baby_centre.weigh(eric)

print(f"Total number of weigh-ins is {baby_centre.weigh_ins()}")

baby_centre.weigh(eric)
baby_centre.weigh(eric)
baby_centre.weigh(eric)
baby_centre.weigh(eric)

print(f"Total number of weigh-ins is {baby_centre.weigh_ins()}")
```

**Sample output:**
```
Total number of weigh-ins is 0
Total number of weigh-ins is 2
Total number of weigh-ins is 6
```
