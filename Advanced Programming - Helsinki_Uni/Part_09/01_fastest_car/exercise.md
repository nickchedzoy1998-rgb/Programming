# Fastest Car

## Exercise Brief

The exercise template contains a class named Car which represents the features of a car through two attributes: make (str) and top_speed (int).

Please write a function named fastest_car(cars: list) which takes a list of Car objects as its argument.

The function should return the make of the fastest car. You may assume there will always be a single car with the highest top speed. Do not change the list given as an argument, or make any changes to the Car class definition.

You may use the following code to test your function:

if __name__ == "__main__":
    car1 = Car("Saab", 195)
    car2 = Car("Lada", 110)
    car3 = Car("Ferrari", 280)
    car4 = Car("Trabant", 85)

    cars = [car1, car2, car3, car4]
    print(fastest_car(cars))

Sample output:

Ferrari
