# Recording Exercise

Please create a class named `Recording` which models a single recording. The class should have one private variable: `__length` of type integer.

Please implement the following:

- a constructor which takes the length as an argument
- a getter method `length` which returns the length of the recording
- a setter method which sets the length of the recording

It should be possible to make use of the class as follows:

```python
the_wall = Recording(43)
print(the_wall.length)
the_wall.length = 44
print(the_wall.length)
```

Sample output:

```text
43
44
```

If the argument for either the constructor or the setter method is below zero, this should raise a `ValueError`.

If you need a refresher on raising exceptions, please see part 6 of the course materials.
