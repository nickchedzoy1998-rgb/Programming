# Hockey statistics

> **NB:** Some exercises have multiple parts, and you can receive points for the different parts separately. You can submit a partially completed exercise by choosing **Submit Solution** from the menu next to the button for executing tests.

In this exercise you will build an application for examining hockey league statistics from the NHL in a couple of different ways.

The exercise template contains two JSON files: `partial.json` and `all.json`. The first of these is mostly meant for testing. The latter contains a lot of data, as all the NHL player stats for the 2019-20 season are included in the file.

The entry for a single player is in the following format:

```json
{
    "name": "Patrik Laine",
    "nationality": "FIN",
    "assists": 35,
    "goals": 28,
    "penalties": 22,
    "team": "WPG",
    "games": 68
}
```

Both files contain a list of entries in the above format.

If you need a refresher on handling JSON files, please take a look at part 7 of this course material.

## Search and list

Please write an interactive application which first asks for the name of the file, and then offers the following functions:

- Search by name for a single player's stats
- List all the abbreviations for team names in alphabetical order
- List all the abbreviations for countries in alphabetical order

These functionalities grant you one exercise point. Your application should now work as follows:

**Sample output**

```text
file name: partial.json
read the data of 14 players

commands:
0 quit
1 search for player
2 teams
3 countries
4 players in team
5 players from country
6 most points
7 most goals

command: 1
name: Travis Zajac

Travis Zajac         NJD   9 + 16 =  25
command: 2
BUF
CGY
DAL
NJD
NYI
OTT
PIT
WPG
WSH

command: 3
CAN
CHE
CZE
SWE
USA

command: 0
```

> **NB:** The printout format for a player must be exactly as follows:

**Sample output**

```text
Leon Draisaitl       EDM  43 + 67 = 110
Connor McDavid       EDM  34 + 63 =  97
Travis Zajac         NJD   9 + 16 =  25
Mike Green           EDM   3 +  8 =  11
Markus Granlund      EDM   3 +  1 =   4
123456789012345678901234567890123456789
```

The last line in the sample above is there to help you calculate the widths of the different fields in the output; you should not print the numbers line yourself in your final submission.

The abbreviation for the team is printed from the 22nd character onwards. The `+` sign is the 30th character and the `=` sign is the 35th character. All the fields should be justified to the right edge. All whitespace is space characters.

F-strings are probably the easiest way to achieve the required printout. The process is similar to this exercise from part 6.

## List players by points

These two functionalities will grant you a second exercise point:

- List players in a specific team in the order of points scored, from highest to lowest. Points equals goals + assists
- List players from a specific country in the order of points scored, from highest to lowest

Your application should now work as follows:

**Sample output**

```text
file name: partial.json
read the data of 14 players

commands:
0 quit
1 search for player
2 teams
3 countries
4 players in team
5 players from country
6 most points
7 most goals

command: 4
team: OTT

Drake Batherson      OTT   3 +  7 =  10
Jonathan Davidsson   OTT   0 +  1 =   1
command: 5
country: CAN

Jared McCann         PIT  14 + 21 =  35
Travis Zajac         NJD   9 + 16 =  25
Taylor Fedun         DAL   2 +  7 =   9
Mark Jankowski       CGY   5 +  2 =   7
Logan Shaw           WPG   3 +  2 =   5
command: 0
```

## Most successful players

These two functionalities will grant you a third exercise point:

- List of `n` players who've scored the most points
  - If two players have the same score, whoever has scored the higher number of goals comes first
- List of `n` players who've scored the most goals
  - If two players have the same number of goals, whoever has played the lower number of games comes first

Your application should now work as follows:

**Sample output**

```text
file name: partial.json
read the data of 14 players

commands:
0 quit
1 search for player
2 teams
3 countries
4 players in team
5 players from country
6 most points
7 most goals

command: 6
how many: 2

Jakub Vrana          WSH  25 + 27 =  52
Jared McCann         PIT  14 + 21 =  35
command: 6
how many: 5

Jakub Vrana          WSH  25 + 27 =  52
Jared McCann         PIT  14 + 21 =  35
John Klingberg       DAL   6 + 26 =  32
Travis Zajac         NJD   9 + 16 =  25
Conor Sheary         BUF  10 + 13 =  23
command: 7
how many: 6

Jakub Vrana          WSH  25 + 27 =  52
Jared McCann         PIT  14 + 21 =  35
Conor Sheary         BUF  10 + 13 =  23
Travis Zajac         NJD   9 + 16 =  25
John Klingberg       DAL   6 + 26 =  32
Mark Jankowski       CGY   5 +  2 =   7
command: 0
```
