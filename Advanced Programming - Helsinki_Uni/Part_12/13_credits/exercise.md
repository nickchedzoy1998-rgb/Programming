# Study credits

> **NB:** Some exercises have multiple parts, and you can receive points for the different parts separately. You can submit a partially completed exercise by choosing **Submit Solution** from the menu next to the button for executing tests.

In this exercise we will work with a slightly modified version of the `CourseAttempt` class. The name of the student is omitted, but the number of credits is included. The class works as follows:

```python
attempt = CourseAttempt("Data Structures and Algorithms", 3, 10)
print(attempt)
print(attempt.course_name)
print(attempt.credits)
print(attempt.grade)
```

**Sample output**

```text
Data Structures and Algorithms (10 cr) grade 3
Data Structures and Algorithms
10
3
```

## The sum of all credits

Please implement a function named `sum_of_all_credits` which takes a list of course attempts as its argument. The function sums up the total number of study credits covered by the courses. It should work like this:

```python
s1 = CourseAttempt("Introduction to Programming", 5, 5)
s2 = CourseAttempt("Advanced Course in Programming", 4, 5)
s3 = CourseAttempt("Data Structures and Algorithms", 3, 10)
credit_sum = sum_of_all_credits([s1, s2, s3])
print(credit_sum)
```

**Sample output**

```text
20
```

Please implement the function using the `reduce` function.

## The sum of passed credits

Please implement a function named `sum_of_passed_credits` which takes a list of course attempts as its argument. The function sums up the credits for the course attempts with grade 1 or above. It should work like this:

```python
s1 = CourseAttempt("Introduction to Programming", 5, 5)
s2 = CourseAttempt("Advanced Course in Programming", 0, 4)
s3 = CourseAttempt("Data Structures and Algorithms", 3, 10)
credit_sum = sum_of_passed_credits([s1, s2, s3])
print(credit_sum)
```

**Sample output**

```text
15
```

Please implement the function using the `reduce` and `filter` functions.

## Average grade for passed courses

Please implement a function named `average` which takes a list of course attempts as its argument. The function calculates the average grade for the course attempts with grade 1 or above. It should work like this:

```python
s1 = CourseAttempt("Introduction to Programming", 5, 5)
s2 = CourseAttempt("Advanced Course in Programming", 0, 4)
s3 = CourseAttempt("Data Structures and Algorithms", 3, 10)
ag = average([s1, s2, s3])
print(ag)
```

**Sample output**

```text
4.0
```

Please implement the function using the `reduce` and `filter` functions.

> **NB:** The exercise asks for a simple mean value, not a weighted average.

While working on this exercise, it is likely worth remembering that the return value of `filter` is an iterator.
