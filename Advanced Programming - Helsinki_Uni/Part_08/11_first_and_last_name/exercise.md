# First And Last Name

## Exercise Brief

Please write a class named Person with a single attribute name, which is set with an argument given to the constructor.

Please also add two methods:

The method return_first_name should return the first name of the person, while the method return_last_name should return the last name of the person.

You may assume that the name passed to the constructor will contain exactly two name elements separated with a space character.

An example use case:

if __name__ == "__main__":
    peter = Person("Peter Pythons")
    print(peter.return_first_name())
    print(peter.return_last_name())

    paula = Person("Paula Pythonnen")
    print(paula.return_first_name())
    print(paula.return_last_name())

# Sample output:

Peter
Pythons
Paula
Pythonnen
