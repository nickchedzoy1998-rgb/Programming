### Products in shopping list

In part 10 you created an iterable `ShoppingList`, and we just learnt that an object created from an iterable class can be used with list comprehensions. The exercise template contains a stripped down version of the `ShoppingList` class with just enough functionality to fulfil the requirements of this exercise.

Please write a function named `products_in_shopping_list(shopping_list, amount: int)` which takes a `ShoppingList` object and an integer value as its arguments. The function should return a list of product names. The list should include only the products with at least the number of items specified by the `amount` parameter.

- Use a list comprehension.
- Do not modify the `ShoppingList` class definition.
- The function must be no longer than two lines of code, including the `def` line.

The function should work as follows:

```python
my_list = ShoppingList()
my_list.add("bananas", 10)
my_list.add("apples", 5)
my_list.add("alcohol free beer", 24)
my_list.add("pineapple", 1)

print("the shopping list contains at least 8 of the following items:")
for product in products_in_shopping_list(my_list, 8):
    print(product)
```

Sample output:

```
the shopping list contains at least 8 of the following items:
bananas
alcohol free beer
```
