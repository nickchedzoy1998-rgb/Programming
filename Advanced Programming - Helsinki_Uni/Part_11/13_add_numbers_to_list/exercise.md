### Add numbers to a list

Please write a recursive function named `add_numbers_to_list(numbers: list)`. The function takes a list of numbers as its argument, and adds new numbers to the list until the length of the list is divisible by five. Each number added to the list should be one greater than the last number in the list.

The function must call itself recursively.

The function should work as follows:

```python
numbers = [1, 3, 4, 5, 10, 11]
add_numbers_to_list(numbers)
print(numbers)
```

Sample output:

```
[1, 3, 4, 5, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15]
```
