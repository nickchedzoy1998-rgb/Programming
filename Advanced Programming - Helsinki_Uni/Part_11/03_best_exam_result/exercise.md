### Best exam result

The exercise template contains the class definition `ExamResult`. The class has the following public attributes:

- name
- grade1
- grade2
- grade3

Please write a function named `best_results(results: list)` which takes a list of `ExamResult` objects as its argument.

The function should return a new list containing only the best result from each `ExamResult` object. The function should use a list comprehension to achieve this.

- The maximum length of the function is two lines of code, including the header line beginning with the `def` keyword.

The function should work as follows:

```python
result1 = ExamResult("Peter", 5, 3, 4)
result2 = ExamResult("Pippa", 3, 4, 1)
result3 = ExamResult("Paul", 2, 1, 3)
results = [result1, result2, result3]
print(best_results(results))
```

Sample output:

```
[5, 4, 3]
```
