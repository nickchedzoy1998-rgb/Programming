### Greatest node

Please write a function named `greatest_node(root: Node)` which takes the root node of a binary tree as its argument.

The function should return the value of the node with the greatest value within the tree. The tree should be traversed recursively.

Hint: the function `sum_of_nodes` in the example above may come in handy.

An example of how the function should work:

```python
if __name__ == "__main__":
    tree = Node(2)

    tree.left_child = Node(3)
    tree.left_child.left_child = Node(5)
    tree.left_child.right_child = Node(8)

    tree.right_child = Node(4)
    tree.right_child.right_child = Node(11)

    print(greatest_node(tree))
```

Sample output

```
11
```
